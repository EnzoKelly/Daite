# GadgetShow - Front-end display

This branch is concerned with creating an interface for the end-user to interact with the AI.

The main ideology of front-end display is as follows:

1. The user is greeted by a welcome screen, briefly describing the purpose of this app.
2. The user enters their name, interests and topics they want to *ideally* talk about.
3. The user gets to choose, from a list, who they want to talk to.
4. The chat is launched, and both parties have three minutes to mingle.
5. After the chat is finished, the user(s) get a chance to vote as to who they just talked with.

If you want to add or change anything, go ahead.

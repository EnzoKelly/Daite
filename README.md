The plan is to create a dating chat-bot.
A random group of people will be asked to try out our 'new dating system', where they can choose who they want to talk to from a list of names and get to know in a ~3 minute time window.
They'll then be asked if they want to have a proper date with the person they talked with.
Some of the people on the list will be real people, and some will be our AI.
Our aim: Get our AI a date!
